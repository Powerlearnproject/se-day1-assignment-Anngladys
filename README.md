Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is applying engineering principles, methods and tools systematically tp develop and maintain high quality software systems. This involves design, development, testing, deployment and maintaining of software products. Software engineering is important in the technology industry because the created applications and systems power various aspects of life such as communication, business, entertainment, lifestyle and healthcare. 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Development of programming languages such as Fortran C
Establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s
The advent of strctured programming in the 1970s
The rise of Agile Methodologies in the 2000s.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements - what do users need? What are the system requirements?
Design - high-level and detailed designs of the software architechture and UI
Implementation - writing code and building according to the design specs
Testing - to ensure quality standards and functional requirements are met
Deployment - releasing it to users/customers
Maintenance - providing support, updates and enhancements


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall has distinct phases flowing and following each other like a waterfall, while Agile is iterative and incremental focusing on flexibility, collboration and response to change.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer - writing code and implementing software solutions
Quality Assurance Engineer - designing and executing test plans
Project Manager - overseeing planning, execution and delivery of software projects


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDE - providing comrehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing code e.g. Visual Studio, Ecliple, Intellij IDEA
VCS - tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among teams e.g. Git, Subversion


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing requirements - clarify the requirements beforehand, and also give additional costs for unexpected changes to encourage focus and timeliness. Effective communication. 
Tight deadlines - be firm on what is possible within certain timelines. Proper prioritization. Regular reassessment of goals and timelines.
Technical debt - avoid shortcuts!!!



Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing - testing individual components/modules
Integration testing - testing interactions between different components or subsystems
System testing - testing the entire software system as a whole
Acceptance testing - testing tehe software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs
Importance - to identify and fix defects early resulting in high-quality software products


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Crafting questions or statments to get the best possible responses from AI models. Giving clear instructions to a very smart assistant.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Draw a house.
Draw a 3-storey-house made of glass and marble, standing by the ocean, surrounded by swaying palm trees. Let there be white sands, a couple of children playing on the beach, a few swimmers in the ocean and a few ladies lying on some benches.
